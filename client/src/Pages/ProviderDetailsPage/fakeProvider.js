    description:
      "Experienced with animals with all kind of characters, I used to live with and walk 6 dogs in my childhood! 3 sheltie, 2 poodle and 1 shiba inu, and with so many pet sitting experience I can deal with and walk both all kinds of dogs, both friendly or unfriendly. Because of my observant nature, i am also very experienced in helping shy or grumpy cats, especially solving conflicts within cats who live in the same household, some client who have cats who fight for years have their conflicts solved after coming for boarding for 2 weeks. I have very good cat instinct because I used to live in a 11 cats household at 1 point of my life, I am just one of them we are family. I love ALL ANIMALS, i love them so much i became vegan",
